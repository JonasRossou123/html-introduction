<h4>A funny story:</h4>

<div class="scroll" style="width:290px;height:200px;line-height:3em;overflow:scroll;padding:30px;margin-left:43%;font-family: copperplate, papyrus, fantasy;font-size:10px">
There once was a ship that put to sea<br>
The name of the ship was the Billy of Tea<br>
The winds blew up, her bow dipped down<br>
Oh blow, my bully boys, blow (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
She'd not been two weeks from shore<br>
When down on her a right whale bore<br>
The captain called all hands and swore<br>
He'd take that whale in tow (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
Da-da-da-da-da<br>
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da<br>
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da<br>
Before the boat had hit the water<br>
The whale's tail came up and caught her<br>
All hands to the side, harpooned and fought her<br>
When she dived down low (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
No line was cut, no whale was freed<br>
The captain's mind was not of greed<br>
And he belonged to the Whaleman's creed<br>
She took that ship in tow (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
Da-da-da-da-da<br>
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da<br>
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da<br>
For forty days or even more <br>
The line went slack then tight once more<br>
All boats were lost, there were only four<br>
But still that whale did go (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
As far as I've heard, the fight's still on<br>
The line's not cut, and the whale's not gone<br>
The Wellerman makes his regular call<br>
To encourage the captain, crew and all (huh)<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go<br>
Soon may the Wellerman come<br>
To bring us sugar and tea and rum<br>
One day, when the tonguing is done<br>
We'll take our leave and go <br>
